#### I start with user research, iterate with interactive prototypes, and end with visual design in code

#### I value teamwork and have experience as a solo designer working closely with developers and managers

#### I'm comfortable with technical domains and evangelizing design

Currently I live in the LA area and create systems engineering tools. My background in academic research and visual communication drives my user research and design practice.  I studied UX and information systems at UC Berkeley. I interned at Amazon.com in Amazon Marketing Services and before grad school researched tools for 3D animators.
