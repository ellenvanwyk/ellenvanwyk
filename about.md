## Background
I&rsquo;m a UX designer and recent graduate of UC Berkeley&rsquo;s School of Information Master&rsquo;s program, where I focused on HCI. Currently I live in the SF Bay area and design community oriented map making tools and research new media with Cornell University. I interned at Amazon.com in Amazon Marketing Services last summer and before grad school researched [tools for 3D animators]("http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/ap/about.html").

I discovered my passion for UX after working in cognitive science and visual arts. Now, my background in academic research and visual communication drives my user research and design practice. I&rsquo;m interested in opportunities to design beautiful products that simplify complicated information systems, and respond to both user and business needs.
