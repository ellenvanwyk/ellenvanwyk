My team at the Animation Research Lab at the UW developed an Autodesk Maya Plugin to help animators learn how to model more recognizable facial expressions. I contributed 3D modeling in Maya, statistics in MATLAB, designed and carried out the user study, and wrote sections of the paper submitted to SIGGRAPH.

## Psychology
For this project, we sought to simplify the complicated and poorly understood behavior of facial expression recognition and classification.  To understand this process, I conducted a literature search on the psychology of facial expression recognition and its current applications in artificial intelligence.  My research informed the development of the prototype.

## Statistics
The nuance and complexity of facial expressions require sophisticated mathematical description.  To interpret and manipulate facial expressions, I analyzed messy, behavioral data and conducted experiments to try to expose patterns.

## Autodesk Maya Integration
To inform our understanding of stylized facial expressions, I also posed and analyzed facial expressions in Maya.  We finally integrated our findings into a Maya Plugin.

## User Study
I designed and analyzed in MATLAB our user study experiement.  I also administered some sessions, contributed to the qualitative study development, and presented the results in our SIGGRAPH Asia submission.
