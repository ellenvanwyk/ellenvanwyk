I led prop shading and contributed to modeling, concept design, and animation for the animated short At Ease, a product of the University of Washington's animation capstone.

## Intro to Animation
In preparation for the film, we created projects in each part of the animation pipeline in Maya, including writing, animating, lighting, and compositing a short.

## At Ease Concept Art Process

For the film, I led the prop shading group to make a consistent look and feel for the whole film.  I also contributed to character design, concept art, 3D modeling, and animation. This was an intensely collaborative and iterative process.

Since our film was set in the 1940's, we compromised between accuracy and visual appeal.

All design decisions had to be motivated by the story and submitted with reference, as I demonstrate to the left.  Over the course of many iterations, the layout evolved into the image on the right as a collaboration with my prop texturing team and the lighting team.  Each design had to be presented with outside reference, and had to fit in with the rest of the props and characters, known as the 'family tree'.
