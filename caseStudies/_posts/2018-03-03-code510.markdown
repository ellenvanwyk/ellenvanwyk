tagline: After school creative coding space
overview: Code 510 is an after school program where youth from the East bay can find mentorship for their self driven projects and learn computing skills. I volunteered as a mentor and webmaster for 2 years.

During my time in Code 510 I supported two game projects: one in <span class = "skill">Javascript</span> and one in 3D using <span class = "skill">Unity and Autodesk Maya</span>. I advise students in the areas of design, concept art, Maya, and code.


I also <span class = "skill">designed</span> and built the website to host Code 510&rsquo;s curriculum and outreach using <span class = "skill">Wordpress</span>. I wanted to represent code 510 by making the site fresh, bright, and modern, but also preserve the DIY spirit of Code 510
