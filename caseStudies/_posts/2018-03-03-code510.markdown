## Overview

Code 510 is an after school program where youth from the East bay can find mentorship for their self driven projects and learn computing skills. I have volunteered as a mentor for Code 510 since Fall 2014 and have supported two game projects: one in <span class = "skill">Javascript</span> and one in 3D using <span class = "skill">Unity and Autodesk Maya</span>. I advise students in the areas of design, concept art, Maya, and code.


Recently I <span class = "skill">designed</span> and built the website to host Code 510&rsquo;s curriculum and outreach using <span class = "skill">Wordpress</span>. This was an opportunity to learn about customizing layout and fields in Wordpress and branding. I wanted to represent code 510 by making the site fresh, bright, and modern but not slick: the learning environment at Code 510 prioritizes process over product and self exploration over polish.
