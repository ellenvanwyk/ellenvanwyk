tagline: Compete to build the best maze
overview: Anton Holmberg and I designed a game in less than a day for the 2014 UC Berkeley UPE Game Jam. Anton designed the gameplay and developed the app while I animated and illustrated the graphics. Amaze won 3rd place in the game jam with over 20 teams.

Amaze is a single player puzzle game for iOS where the player who creates the most complicated maze wins. I am designing a maze for the computer (blue character) and the AI builds a maze for my magenta character when I hit run.  The player who builds the best maze for the opponent will reach the finish line first and win.</span></figcaption>
