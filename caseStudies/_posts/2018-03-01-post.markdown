Anton Holmberg and I designed a game in less than a day for the 2014 UC Berkeley UPE Game Jam. We identified our team's skills (2D illustration and iOS) and constraints of the desired gameplay (multiplayer maze game) to guide the design and implementation. Amaze won 3rd place in the game jam with over 20 teams.

## Demo

Amaze is a single player puzzle game for iOS where the player who creates the most complicated maze wins. I am designing a maze for the computer (blue character) and the AI builds a maze for my magenta character when I hit run.  The player who builds the best maze for the opponent will reach the finish line first and win.</span></figcaption>
